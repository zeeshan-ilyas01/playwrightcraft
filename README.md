## commands and statements

To execute specific file 
```npx playwright test tests/codegen.spec.js
```

### Page Object Model
 important concepts before implement POM 
 class
 constructors
 methods


### pages
```
export default login{
     constructor(page) {

        this.page = page
        this.username="#email1"
     }
     async loginToAppliatio() {

        await this.page.fill(this.username, "admin@email.com")
      
    }

}
```
export default makes importing cleaner and more intuitive:



### main
```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'
import LoginPageclass from '../../pages/loginpage.js'
const login = new LoginPageclass(page)
test('loging with POM', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('https://freelance-learn-automation.vercel.app/login')
    await login.loginToAppliatio()
    })

```

### Git Commands

```
git init
git status
git add filename or git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git log
git branch -M main
git branch 
git remote add origin githubURL
git push -u origin main
```
