## commands and statements

To execute specific file 
```npx playwright test tests/codegen.spec.js
```
For headed mode
```
```npx playwright test tests/Filename.spec.js --headed
```
 import {test, expect} from '@playwright/test' 
this imports test and expect module from playwright library
await page.pause()
this will pause the project open the record a test.

await context.close();
It closes the entire browser context, which includes all the pages/tabs opened within it.
Close all tabs and clean up everything for this browser profile."



viewportSize() for screen size

retry can be used for sigle and group of tests.



### Page Object Model
 important concepts before implement POM 
 class
 constructors
 methods


### pages
```
export default login{
     constructor(page) {

        this.page = page
        this.username="#email1"
     }
     async loginToAppliatio() {

        await this.page.fill(this.username, "admin@email.com")
      
    }

}
```
export default makes importing cleaner and more intuitive:



### main
```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'
import LoginPageclass from '../../pages/loginpage.js'
const login = new LoginPageclass(page)
test('loging with POM', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('https://freelance-learn-automation.vercel.app/login')
    await login.loginToAppliatio()
    })

```
